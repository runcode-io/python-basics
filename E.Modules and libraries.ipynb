    "In Python, a library is a collection of pre-compiled routines that a program can use. \n",
    "These routines, also known as modules, can be written in Python or written in other languages and then compiled for use in Python.\n",
    "Libraries can contain a variety of different types of elements, including functions, classes, variables, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules are Python code files that contain definitions and statements. A module can define functions, classes, and variables, and can also include runnable code.\n",
    "Modules can be imported into other modules or into the main module (also known as the global module).\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a library or module in a Python program, you must first import it. This is done using the import statement.\n",
    "For example, to import the math module, you would use the following statement:"

    "    NumPy - A library for scientific computing with Python, including support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.\n",
    "    Pandas - A library for data manipulation and analysis, including functions for reading and writing data, filtering and aggregation, and handling missing data.\n",
    "    Matplotlib - A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.\n",
